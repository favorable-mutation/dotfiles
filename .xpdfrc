#     `unix'	= LF
#     `dos'	= CR+LF
#     `mac'	= CR

# If set to "yes", text extraction will keep all characters. If set to "no",
# text extraction will discard tiny (smaller than 3 point) characters after
# the first 50000 per page, avoiding extremely slow run times for PDF files
# that use special fonts to do shading or cross-hatching. This defaults to
# "no".
