# Sound Scripts

These scripts set and unset certain system sound settings to make your MacBook
stop making noise. My use case is running sound for theatrical productions from
my machine.

## Usage

To run the scripts, first make them executable:

```chmod u+x set-levels unset-levels```

Then run from the terminal:

```./set-levels```

You will then be prompted for input.
